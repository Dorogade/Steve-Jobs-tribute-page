    <p>
        Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor,
        and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., 
        the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following 
        its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of 
        the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        Pre-Apple (1972–1985)
        In February 1974, Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job.
        He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, which gave him a job as a technician.
        Back in 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave the board to Jobs. 
        According to Wozniak, Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company, 
        and they thought that he had built it himself.
        Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as "difficult but valuable", 
        pointing out that "he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that."

        By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it;
        Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed. In April of that same year,
        Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) 
        as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home on April 1, 1976.

        NeXT computer (1985–1997)
        Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc.with $7 million. 
        A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. 
        Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.
        The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event, 
        a lavish invitation-only gala launch event that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.
        The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California on Wednesday October 12, 1988. 
        Steve Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was "really getting his head together".

        Pixar and Disney (1986)
        In 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price
        of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm
        for technology rights.
